# Introduction

The hardest part of maximizing growth without spending money is to be
hyper vigilant around how you manage your resources. When talking about
resources, it is not just the 5 resources that you should see at the top
of your screen (this will be covered later if it is not already
labeled), but anything else that you have direct control over as a
player.

How and when you spend your resources has a direct impact on how many
resources you receive in the long run. Success grows on success. The
better you do in the early game, the faster you can grow once you really
start growing. You will never be able to compete week in and week out
with the people who spend money, but you could save up for a month and
have a baller of a week trying to win some of those big prizes.

# Resources

## Primary

Primary resources are what you use to buy secondary resources. In here
you will find a non-exhaustive list of what I consider primary resources
and some tips on how I think about them.

-   Gold
    -   This is the one of the few resources that you have direct
        control over.
    -   Do whatever you can to increase your offline gold production and
        to speed up mining
    -   Keep heroes with an increase to offline gold output as the
        leader unless you need to increase power for PvP
-   Stone
    -   Most abundant of your castle building resources
    -   If you have a lot of these, exchange them for wood
-   Wood
    -   Depending on which part of the game you are in, this could be
        your most scarce castle resource until your saved up iron runs
        out.
-   Iron
    -   Your most scarce castle resource. I use all my free-pick castle
        resources collecting Iron.
-   Gems
    -   This is probably your most precious resource
    -   Mostly obtained via events and alliance gifts
    -   Spend casually if you are not spending real money to get more
        gems
    -   Save these for discount store items
    -   Focus on AP potions and teleports
-   Alliance Silver
    -   The biggest thing to buy is the daily desert castles
        -   This generates 1 platinum coupon per day in the exchange
            shop
    -   Talent books and skill shards are also a good purchase here
-   Mithril
    -   There are so many other things to balance that keeping it simple
        in Mithril can save some sanity.
        -   You are likely to forget to go in and re-attack advanced
            mithril every 15 - 20 minutes when you get kicked out
    -   Focus on buying things that you are working to level up
    -   While daily rewards are always important, do not skip out on
        collecting the weekly treasures. You can level up some things
        quick now that they have increased the number of items that can
        be bought per week.
-   Goddess Coins
    -   Buy AP here... There isn't much else worth it.
-   Magic Stones
    -   Free-pick heroes or tech pieces are good from here.
-   Expedition Gold
    -   Complete all your quests and alliance quests!
        -   This can be difficult, especially with limited AP
        -   Take advantage of alliance members rallying things as much
            as possible.
    -   Only buy 1 or 2 things from the top row
        -   Daily is preferred, but less than that helps you save up
            faster
    -   Buy the 800,000 gold treasures
        -   You can save up enough to get 3 of these from a single
            Broken Lands
        -   You will need 2 per troop as it only grants power to the
            leader of a troop
-   Crystal
    -   You get crystal every time you mine gold in the Broken Lands
        -   If you are not working on your quests, live in level 4 gold
            mines
            -   Save the level 5 mines for alliance members wanting to
                complete quests
    -   This is the second place to spend money if you are going that
        route
        -   Buy the Season Crystal Card and get double the crystals
        -   Secondly, buy the double rewards from the Expedition Crystal
            Pass
-   Dragon Insignia
    -   The weakest of resources
    -   Can buy some neat temporary buffs with it, or a limited amount
        of whatever you need to push something to that next level.

# The Exchange of Resources

This is really the meat and potatoes of everything that is going on. You
likely have a decent idea of where and how to obtain resources. The
problem however is doing it as efficiently as possible. Having the
patience to only spend resources on certain days instead of using
everything up as soon as you get it is the key to success.

## Your Castle

Your castle level only really determines one thing at the end of the
day... How hard your troops hit in tower defense. Yes, the troops also
follow your hero into battle, but other buffs mean a LOT more than troop
level. Especially after you max out offline gold output at stage 20,000.

One trick that has helped save a lot of time is keeping the stage level
as low as possible while keeping my castle level as high as possible.
When you get a quest that is "complete 50 stages" or "complete 150"
stages, then you can knock that out in less than 10 minutes if your
first troop is destroying 95% of the enemies in tower defense. If
enemies are making it halfway through the maze (not including the
enemies that fly straight through) then you are spending too much time
in tower defense mode.

## Daily Quests

Most of your time will be spent thinking about all the different things
you need to do every day. This is not limited to the daily quests behind
the dragon head in the menu, but any events that are happening as well.
Only do the bare minimum to complete these quests such as leveraging
rallies to get titan kills out of the way.

## Weekly Quests

The weekly quests are probably the most important quests as they give
out the best rewards.

### Mightiest / Ultimate Kingdom

These quests require you to spend resources on specific days of the
week. It is very important that you follow the schedule so that you can
rank high enough in events to earn extra resources. If you are a lower
level competing with higher level people, consider skipping a week to
save up even more resources for the next week.

-   Monday
    -   Master Talent Book
    -   Crown of the Oracle
    -   EXP Books
-   Tuesday
    -   Dragon Runes
    -   Light Reagents
    -   Forge Hammers
-   Wednesday
    -   Light reagents
    -   Strengthening Potions
    -   Fortune Potions
-   Thursday
    -   Forge Hammers
-   Friday
    -   Dragon Runes
-   Saturday
    -   Hero Cards

You will notice that some days have overlapping resources that you can
spend. I tend to split my Dragon Runes between Tuesday and Friday as
they seem to be the most common and use the other resources on their
respective solo days. Saturday is the most important day as it is the
day that most points are gained for the overall winner.

### Lava Haka

Make sure that you get in all 20 personal and alliance challenges for
this quest.

### Evil Spirit Invasion

Even if you do not actively participate in this event, make sure that
all your troops are in your castle and that your castle is near your
alliance's hive. This event gives out a lot of rewards and you want to
ensure that you do not miss out on prizes due to your troops being
somewhere else.

## Alliance Quests

Alliance quests are your main source for platinum coupons (castle skins
and frames) and a decent source for alliance silver and normal chests.
While multiple people can reach the same number of points, whoever gets
there first gets a higher ranking. First place comes with 1,000 gems,
10,000 alliance silver, and 50 chests! That's not something that you
want to miss.

When the week starts off, refresh all your quests until you have nothing
but yellow quests. You will notice a theme of quests and it is best to
have as many quests within a single theme as possible.

For example, you could have "Gather 8 million gold" and "Gather 10
million gold."b

### Gather Gold

These quests are straight forward. If you want to speed these up, sit in
a dragon's nest the day before new quests come out and have 10 million
gold ready to turn in as soon as you get your quests settled.

### Spend Gold

Spend all the gold you gathered before on anything.

This pairs well with "Gather Gold" and "Perform Normal Recruitment". I
also like to spend gold in the Academy to help achieve this one.

### Perform Normal Recruitment

I like this one as I am buying 2,000 normal cards from the Tavern every
day anyway. The day before new quests are issued, I will save my 2,000
cards from that day so that I can recruit 4,000 heroes on day 1.

### Perform Advanced Recruitment

This one can be a mixed bag as it is likely the 2nd hardest line of
quests to complete within a week through normal gameplay.

If you already have an ongoing event that requires you to recruit from
advanced 10 times a day anyway, this one would only require 10 - 30 more
advanced recruitments to complete within a week. Events and gems are the
main way of getting these cards though and it can be challenging to keep
up with 10 advanced recruitments per day.

### Use Action Points

Assuming you have at least 400 action points per day (300 base + 100 in
free recharges), you should be able to complete these within a week. Be
careful when trying to complete these quests as action potions and gems
might be needed to complete.

### Normal and Advanced Chests

You will need 200 normal chests and 150 advanced chests to complete all
of these. My strategy is to save up all my chests every week until I hit
those targets. I then allow myself to open any chests throughout the
week that exceed those numbers. If you have a low VIP level and not a
lot of action points, these may be difficult to obtain.

#### Normal Chest Strategies

Ignoring the Broken Lands, you should be able to generate 100 chests per
week without spending any money or explicit action points (you will
likely spend action points completing events which awards chests).

-   You get 4x normal chests every time your legion captures a fortress
    in the broken lands.
    -   This is going to be the cheapest and most abundant way to
        collect chests.
    -   Hold on to these with dear life and only use them to meet your
        alliance quest goals.
-   Lava Cave will give almost 50 normal chests per week
-   Jennifer's quests
    -   This competes for AP with advanced chests
-   Personal Broken Land achievements
-   Discount store pass (standard)
    -   25 normal chests per week
-   Elemental Lord
    -   6 chests per week
-   Kill Monsters
    -   6 chests per week
-   Evil Spirit Invasion
    -   20 - 28 chests per week

#### Advanced Chest Strategies

-   Rally titans
    -   This obviously eats up a lot of action points
-   Join Rally Event
    -   6 chests
-   Lava Trial\*\*\*\*
    -   40 advanced quests per week while using no action points

### Log In

This one is self-explanatory and easy to do.

### Challenge Titans

Auto rally counts for this. It should be super easy to complete this if
you are getting in your 50 free rallies per day.

### Spend Gems

I assume most everyone will spend 4000 gems over the course of a week.
If not, feel free to skip this one as this guide is all about how to
complete things without spending money.

### Upgrade Castle

In my opinion, this is the hardest set of quests to complete unless you
are still very early in the game. I will usually only try to complete
these if I have been saving up castle resources for a few weeks.

### Upgrade Hero Levels

This task can be difficult unless you get creative.

##### Strategy

It takes 18 Daniel cards (1800 exp) to take a hero from level 1 to level
10. The good thing about this quest is that it doesn't matter how you
achieve the levels, if you upgrade a hero from 1 to 10th level 78 times
then you will complete this challenge.

From a practical standpoint, this means that for 1,404 Daniels this
quest is complete. You do not have to think of this as throwing away
these cards and this experience though. You can use already leveled up
cards to level up other cards. So, whenever you are done with this
quest, you just feed these quest heroes into the normal heroes you are
trying to level up.

##### The tradeoffs

You will lose 900 hero exp every time you do this. That means for every
16 - 17 heroes that you pump up and eat in this way, you will lose 1
higher level worth of exp. So, if you exclusively get your 700 hero
levels this way, you will lose about 4.5 levels worth of exp that you
will not be able to apply to your bigger troops. In my opinion, the
rewards make up for it as 4.5 levels do not mean much when you are 500+.
